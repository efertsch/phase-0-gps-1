# Woojae Yi GPS 1.1 Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with being fluent in the terminal and Git commands. I didn't understand all the Git commands being used and how Master and feature-branches worked functionally.

* What concepts were clarified during GPS?
The Git workflow was thoroughly practiced, and the difference between git pull and git fetch. After the GPS, my partner Ethan and I stayed a little longer to discuss merge conflicts and bounced back and forth our understanding of how the Master and branches work in tandem.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Post-GPS I asked my partner Ethan a bit about his understanding of the Master and branches to discuss merge conflicts and how they arise. During the GPS, I asked our Guide Aji about the Git Workflow, especially working with git add/commit/push.

* What still confuses you about Git?
I don't think I am too confused so far with Git but I am sure that there is still more to learn and more ways to use GitHub than I have been introduced to so I expect questions to arise in the future.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience of pairing in a GPS went extremely well. We didn't finish all the releases in the alotted hour but my partner and I stayed a little longer to discuss the rest of the session. Our Guide Aji made sure to stop us at key junctions of the session to introduce something we may have overlooked or to teach us something useful.
