# Release 7 Reflection Questions

	* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
		During the first week and a half I have sturggled with trying to figure out when to use which commands. What we have learned so far is merely the tip of the iceberg. The documentation surrounding Git is pretty extensive. Keeping track of which workflow steps to follow at which time has also been tricky at times, I find myself overthinking or feeling like I am missing a step (I have been trying to become less dependent on my notes). 

	* What concenpts were claried during the GPS?

		During the GPS our guide was helpful in walking us through some of the different features and functionality of GitHub which was nice, I got a better understanding of how they could be applied. I also got clarification about the use of 'git fetch and git pull' which I was having some trouble differentiating.

	* What questions did you ask your pair and guide?

		I asked my guide about the git pull and git fetch commands, and about assigning rights access to a collaborator. 
		My pair and I asked each other quite a few questions throught the session, like what commands we thought best to use and why, as well as checking in often to make sure we agreed. We also went back and fourth a lot on the 5th release with regards to the merge conflict and how it works/can be repaired. 

	* What still confuses you about Git?

		Again, the amount of commands I am unfamiliar with is a bit intimidating, and a little confusing. I also need more practice (of which I will surely get!) using Git and GitHub together in order to better understand branching and workflow, I'll get there though!


	* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

		I actually had both of my first pairing experiences today (peer pairing first) and I loved it! It was really nice to work through problems with other members of my cohort, learn alongside them, and support one another through the challenges. The GPS in particular ws really successful, our guide was really great - helpful, but not *too* helpful and my partner was really patient and insightful. I look forward to participating in more pairing in the upcoming weeks!
